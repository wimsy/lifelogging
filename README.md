# Wimsy's lifelogging download scripts

These are just a few scripts I'm throwing together to grab all the excellent lifelogging data I'm putting into the cloud.

Each service has a shell script suitable for cron jobs.

So far I'm pulling data from:

- [Moves](http://moves-app.com)
- [OpenPaths](http://openpaths.cc)

Services I plan to add in the future:

- [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com)
- [FitBit](http://fitbit.com)
- [LoseIt!](http://loseit.com)
- [Garmin](http://connect.garmin.com)
- [Withings](http://my.withings.com)
- [RunKeeper](http://runkeeper.com)
- [Automatic](http://automatic.com) if they add an API
- [Untappd](http://untappd.com)
